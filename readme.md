## About

* * *

An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform
calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized
devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first
microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. They
later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas).

Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy
desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the
incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade,
prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they
became common in schools.

## Tooling information

* * *

Targeted audience we are building for is MacOSX and Linux users. This project uses
[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) `0.56.0` and newer.

## Setup, Compile and Install

* * *

We should make sure the test run with no failed test cases:

```console
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pytest test/run_tests.py
```

Installing should be easy. We install the application like so:

```console
python3 setup.py install
```

And finally we run this cool application:

```console
prog
```
